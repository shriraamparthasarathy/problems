//Constraints :

//From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).
//We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) is <= 0.
//We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.
//Example:

//Input: points[m][n] = { {-2, -3,   3}, 
//                      {-5, -10,  1}, 
//                      {10,  30, -5} 
//                    };
//Output: 7
//Explanation: 
//7 is the minimum value to reach destination with 
//positive throughout the path. Below is the path.

//(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2)

//We start from (0, 0) with 7, we reach(0, 1) 
//with 5, (0, 2) with 2, (1, 2) with 5, (2, 2)
//with and finally we have 1 point (we needed 
//greater than 0 points at the end).

//We can solve this problem through bottom-up table filling dynamic programing technique.

//To begin with, we should maintain a 2D array dp of the same size as the grid, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum points that guarantees the continuation of the journey to destination before entering the cell (i, j). It’s but obvious that dp[0][0] is our final solution. Hence, for this problem, we need to fill the table from the bottom right corner to left top.
//Now, let us decide minimum points needed to leave cell (i, j) (remember we are moving from bottom to up). There are only two paths to choose: (i+1, j) and (i, j+1). Of course we will choose the cell that the player can finish the rest of his journey with a smaller initial points. Therefore we have: min_Points_on_exit = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
//Now we know how to compute min_Points_on_exit, but we need to fill the table dp[][] to get the solution in dp[0][0].

//How to compute dp[i][j]?
//   The value of dp[i][j] can be written as below.

//dp[i][j] = max(min_Points_on_exit – points[i][j], 1)


//Let us see how above expression covers all cases.

//If points[i][j] == 0, then nothing is gained in this cell; the player can leave the cell with the same points as he enters the room with, i.e. dp[i][j] = min_Points_on_exit.
//If points[i][j] < 0, then the player must have points greater than min_Points_on_exit before entering (i, j) in order to compensate for the points lost in this cell. The minimum amount of compensation is " – points[i][j] ", so we have dp[i][j] = min_Points_on_exit – points[i][j].
//If points[i][j] > 0, then the player could enter (i, j) with points as little as min_Points_on_exit – points[i][j]. since he could gain “points[i][j]” points in this cell. However, the value of min_Points_on_exit – points[i][j] might drop to 0 or below in this situation. When this happens, we must clip the value to 1 in order to make sure dp[i][j] stays positive:
//dp[i][j] = max(min_Points_on_exit – points[i][j], 1).
//Finally return dp[0][0] which is our answer.
